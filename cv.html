This page is for your CV, done up in html format.
Some folks use markdown for their online CV,
Others will embed a pdf, and there are many more options.
Html is nice because of the added design freedom, but note that

See /assets/css/main.scss for the file where the style is set for this class --->

{% include header.html %}
